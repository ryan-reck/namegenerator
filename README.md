# Name Generator

A random generator for pronounceable names. Uses the international
phonetic alphabet to generate a sequence of sounds rather than a
sequence of characters so almost every name produced can be said. Also
provides the possible spellings of the name using English
pronunciation rules.

# Usage

Takes no commandline arguments, but always starts an interactive name
generation session.

## Interaction keys

n - generate next name with original algorithm
m - generate next name with second algorithm
s - saves the last name to a file ('names.list')
